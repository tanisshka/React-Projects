      <h2>BMI Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        BMI is a measurement of a person's leanness or corpulence based on their
        height and weight, and is intended to quantify tissue mass. It is widely
        used as a general indicator of whether a person has a healthy body
        weight for their height.
      </p>
      <p>
        The value obtained from BMI is used to categorize whether a person is
        underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese. While BMI is not a
        perfect measure of health, it helps indicate whether further evaluation
        may be required.
